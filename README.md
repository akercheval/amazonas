####Amazonas
A python version of The Game of the Amazons, coded for IIC1103 at La Pontificía Universidad Católica de Chile, for fall (or I guess here it's spring) 2016.
This repo is entirely for peace of mind in case something happens to my code, but if you want to download it and play, go for it, champ.
I guess this could also be of interest if you want to see what code looks like when it's written in a Spanish-speaking country!
